    This is the English privacy policy. It does not have to be exactly the same 
    format as the French one.

    We appreciate your lawyers will most likely write this document for you, and 
    they might not have enough time nor programming skills to actually make sure 
    it matches exactly the structure of the French privacy policy. Hence why this 
    text is actually in its own HTML file. To allow them to focus on their job 
    rather than being a developer.
